# Time Complexity : O(L)  # L = number of logs, each processed once
# Space Complexity : O(n)  # stack + result array
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this :
# - Initially confused how to handle overlapping times (when one function pauses while another runs).
# - Fixed by updating the top of stackâ€™s function time before pushing a new one.

# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach :
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Approach:
# We simulate the call stack using a list.
# Each log has three parts: function_id, "start"/"end", and timestamp.
# 
# When a function starts:
#   - If another function was already running (stack not empty),
#     we add the time spent since the previous timestamp to the top function.
#   - Then we push the new function onto the stack.
#
# When a function ends:
#   - We pop it from the stack and add its total duration
#     (current_time - previous_time + 1) since 'end' is inclusive.
#   - Update previous timestamp to current_time + 1.
#
# The final result array will store the exclusive time for each function.
